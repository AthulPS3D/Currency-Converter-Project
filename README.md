## Working of the project

It is a Ul based real time currency converter which converts the value of one currency to another by using the API which helps the program to take the real time rates of the currency to be converted. Here we imported PyQt5 module for designing UI and requests module (allows you to send HTTP requests) for receiving and using API calls. We have also gave an interchange button to switch between the selected currencies.
